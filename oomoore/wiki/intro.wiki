<h3>Object Oriented Moore Type State Machines in Tcl</h3>
<p>
With the release of Tcl 8.6,
an object system has been built into the core.
The new object system provides provides fundamental capabilities to build
sophisticated object oriented programming environments and also serves as
small object system in itself.

<p>
The
[/doc/trunk/packages/package-oomoore-1.0-tcl.tm|oomoore package]
uses the TclOO commands available in Tcl 8.6 to define a meta-class
that can be used to specify state behavior for Tcl objects.
The link references a package file that may be installed directly into
your teacup.

<p>
The background in state machines described for the
[/doc/tip/moore/wiki/intro.wiki|moore package]
package applies to <em>oomoore</em>, so we won't repeat it here.
