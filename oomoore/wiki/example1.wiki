<h3>A Simple Example</h3>
<p>
We will use the same example used to describe the moore package.
You may wish to first look at the oomoore manual documentation for the
[/doc/trunk/moore/doc/oomoore.html|oomoore package]
or you can just follow along here and review the manual later.

<h4>Washing machine</h4>
The subject of this example is simple washing machine.
Washing machines exhibit a circular pattern in that they proceed
to perform their operations one step after another,
eventually returning to the original state.
<p>
Our washing machine consists of several components that we need to control:
<ul>
<li>A water valve that we can open and close.</li>
<li>A washing tub where the clothes and water are washed.
The tub has a sensor that can tell us when the tub is full of water
and when it is empty.</li>
<li>A pump to remove water from the tub.</li>
<li>A motor that can be used to agitate the clothes and spin the water
out of them.
</li>
</ul>
