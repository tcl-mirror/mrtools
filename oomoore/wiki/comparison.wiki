<h3>Comparing oomoore to moore</h3>
The <b>oomoore</b> package accomplishes the same intent as the <b>moore</b>
package.
Here are some comparisons between the two packages.
<ul>
<li>
    The <b>moore</b> package uses an object oriented approach based on
    namespace ensembles where <b>oomoore</b> uses TclOO.
    If you are not running Tcl 8.6, then you must use <b>moore</b> or
    you must use the TclOO package that back ports to 8.5.
</li>
<li>
    While the <b>moore</b> package works well, it is a rather over engineered
    solution.
    It is not as convenient to use, uses some rather heavy weight data
    structures in its implementation and also is more difficult to have
    data associated with the state machines. By using a state model as
    a superclass, <b>oomoore</b> can be used to give state behavior to
    any other TclOO class.
</li>
</ul>
Regardless of which package you may use, the 
[/doc/trunk/moore/wiki/workflow.wiki|workflow]
suggestions still apply and <b>oomoore</b> makes it much easier to
fit within a TclOO design.
