<h3>Mealy Type State Machines in Tcl</h3>
<p>
Finite state machines are a powerful abstraction that can be used to
structure the sequencing of programs.
Here we give an example of usage for Mealy type state machines.
This package is a counterpart to the
[/doc/tip/moore/wiki/intro.wiki | Moore package].
We will implement the same example as discussed for the Moore package in
terms of Mealy state machines.
<h4>Mealy package</h4>
<p>
Here we describe the
[/doc/trunk/packages/package-mealy-1.4-tcl.tm|mealy package].
This is a Tcl extension that facilitates designing state machines into
your Tcl programs.
The link references a package file that may be installed directly into
your teacup.
