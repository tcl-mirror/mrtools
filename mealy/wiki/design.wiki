<h3>Program Design Considerations</h3>
<p>
It is important to remember that the events generated to state machines
are implemented by the <b>mealy</b> package using the Tcl event loop.
So, event delivery is asynchronous.
After generating an event, execution continues immediately and the
dispatch of the event will happen only when the event loop is entered.
This implies that the design of your program should be event driven.
Event driven designs are unfamiliar to some folks, but the point here is
that the state machines are intended to support an event driven design.
<p>
As it turns out, the <b>mealy</b> package also supports synchronous
delivery of events (using the <b>receive</b> method).
This type of execution model is useful in certain contexts,
but the example we present now is event driven.
