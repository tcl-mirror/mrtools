== Model marking
Model marking

* marking is analogous to semantic analysis for a language compiler.

* model compiler does not generate the model you should have written.


* mark instance creation/deletion -- both sync and async
* mark attributes as read/written
  - reading/writing of referential attributes
* mark relationships traversed and direction

* mark instance access by attribute values vs. relationship navigation

* elide identifying attributes
  - when you can and when you cannot

* use of class operations

=== Optimizations

* composition of related instances

* generalization relationships union/non-union
