== Literate Programming

[[literate-programming]]
The source for this document conforms to
http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[asciidoc] syntax.
This document is also a
http://www.literateprogramming.com/[literate program].
The source code for the implementation is included directly in the document
source and the build process extracts the source that is then given to the Tcl
interpreter.
This process is known as __tangle__ing.
The program,
http://repos.modelrealization.com/cgi-bin/fossil/tcl-cm3/[+atangle+],
is available to extract source code from the document source
and the +asciidoc+ tool chain can be used to produce a variety
of different output formats, although PDF is the intended choice.

The goal of a literate program is to explain the logic of the
program in an order and fashion that facilitates human understanding of the
program and then _tangle_ the document source to obtain
the Tcl code in an order suitable for the Tcl interpreter.
Briefly,
code is extracted from the literate source by
defining a series of _chunks_ that contain the source.
A chunk is _defined_ by including its name as:

........................
<<chunk name>>=
........................

The trailing +=+ sign denotes a definition.
A chunk definition ends at the end of the source block
or at the beginning of another chunk definition.
A chunk may be _referenced_ from within a chunk definition by
using its name without the trailing +=+ sign, as in:

........................
<<chunk definition>>=
    <<chunk reference>>
........................

Chunk names are arbitrary strings.
Multiple definitions with the same name are simply concatenated in the order
they are encountered.
There are one or more _root chunks_ which form the conceptual tree
for the source files that are contained in the literate source.
By convention, root chunks are named the same as the file name to
which they will be tangled.
Tangling is then the operation of starting at a root chunk and
recursively substituting the definition for the chunk references that
are encountered.

For readers who are unfamiliar with the literate style and
who are adept at reading source code directly,
the chunks definitions and reordering
provided by the tangle operation can be a bit disconcerting at first.
You can, of course, examine the tangled source output,
but if you read the program as a document,
you will have to trust that the
author managed to arrange the chunk definitions and references in
a manner so that the tangled output is acceptable to the Tcl interpreter.
