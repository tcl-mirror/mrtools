    <revremark>
        Added ability to specify zero initialized attribute. This helps
        deal with problems of specifying more complexly structured
        attributes which can then be initialized in a constructor
        if necessary.

        Corrected a problem in the code generation for assigning

        subclass instances.

    <date>August 17, 2018</date>
    <authorinitials>GAM</authorinitials>
    <revremark>
        Correction to runtime code to fix possible dereference of a NULL
        pointer when creating simple relationship links for
        associative classes and to fix logic associated with determining
        whether there are duplicated association class instances.

    <revnumber>1.1.5</revnumber>
    <date>March 20, 2019</date>
    <authorinitials>GAM</authorinitials>
    <revremark>
        Corrected a problem with the way instance counts were handled
        for union subclasses.
        The instance count in the class structure was set at the
        number of subtype instances in the initial instance population.
        This failed to account for subtype migration and that
        external instance ID numbering is based on the instances of the
        ultimate supertype of a generalization.

    <revremark>
        Corrected a problem with the declaration of the storage pool for
        multiple assigners.
        Minor improvements in man page documents.

    <revnumber>1.1.7</revnumber>
    <date>December 5, 2019</date>
    <authorinitials>GAM</authorinitials>
    <revremark>
	Corrected an error in the generated code for conditional
	relationship traversal. The code assumed
	a loop control structure was generated and used a
	break statement. This was not the case for singular
	relationships.

    <revnumber>1.1.8</revnumber>
    <date>April 5, 2020</date>
    <authorinitials>GAM</authorinitials>
    <revremark>
        Trim white space on type names given to the typealias
        command. This caused unintended parsing errors.
        Improved code generation for the findByIdInstance command
        by introducing another temporary variable.

    <revnumber>1.2.0</revnumber>
    <date>November 16, 2020</date>
    <authorinitials>GAM</authorinitials>
    <revremark>
        Corrected an error in referential integrity checking for
        union based generalizations.
        The case of a subclass instance having been deleted and its
        superclass instance remaining was not caught.
        Corrected a problem with multiple assigners partitioned
        by a class which is also a subclass of a union-based
        generalization.
        Added referential integrity checks for domain operations.
        Now referential integrity is enforced both at the end
        of a thread of control and after a domain operation.

    <revnumber>1.3.0</revnumber>
    <date>December 31, 2020</date>
    <authorinitials>GAM</authorinitials>
    <revremark>
        Add the ability to signal events periodically.
        This implied changes to the run time and an additional
        embedded command to access the feature.
        The run time handling of expiring the delayed event
        queue was also changed to simplify the processing
        and allow periodic events to be requeued immediately
        upon expiration.
