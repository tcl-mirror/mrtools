= The Micca Platform

[partintro]
--
In this part we present a class model of the platform specific model used
by `micca`.
Some readers will have studied platform independent models.
These are sometimes referred to as _meta-models_.
There is no single meta-model for XUML.
You can express the rules of executable modeling in a number of ways,
although the several meta-models that have been developed have,
as would be expected,
many of the same constructs in them.
The model we present here is platform specific.
The platform we are targeting is single threaded with ``C'' as the
implementation language.
The platform also assumes that all data will be held in primary memory
and that all data storage is statically allocated.
Consequently,
some of the constructs in this model will be decidedly implementation
oriented.
It is, after all, meant to be specific to a particular computing technology.
A single threaded, ``C'' based implementation is *not* an appropriate
basis for all executable models.
It is suitable, however, for a large class of applications.
That is generally true of all translation technologies.
You must be specific about the chosen class of applications and then
choose appropriate computing technology that is applicable to that class
of applications.
There is no such thing as a universal software architecture any more than
there is a universal programming language.
All involve trade-offs of usually conflicting needs and requirements.

The role of the platform model is central to the overall translation
scheme.
Populating this model is the primary focus of the `micca` domain specific
language.
The code generation phase of the translation will query the populated
platform model to produce ``C'' language output to implement the
semantics of the model.

Consequently,
we devote considerable effort to describing the platform model.
We divide the discussion up into several sections focused on
a particular subsystem of the platform model.
The platform model itself is implemented as a `rosea` domain.
Intermixed with the platform model description is the implementation of the
model in `rosea`.

== Domain Subsystem

=== Introduction

The domain subsystem is concerned with defining the basic elements
of what constitutes a domain
Below is the UML class diagram for the domain subsystem of the platform model.

image::platform-domain.pdf[title="Domain Subsystem Class Diagram"]

[[domain-subsystem-discussion]]
A *Domain* is identified by a *Name*.
A *Domain* consists of a set of *Domain Elements* (*R1*).
*Domain Elements* are of two types (*R2*),
*Class* and *Relationship*.
*R2* insures that classes and relationships have different names and this
insures there are no naming conflicts in the generated code.
For the *Domain Element.Name* attribute and many other names,
we will insist that the names be usable as ``C'' language identifiers,
_i.e._ they must start with a letter followed by an arbitrary number of
letters, digits or underscore characters.
The code generation process will use these names directly since this
eases the burden of finding model elements in the generated implementation.

A *Domain* may also define a set of *Domain Operation* (*R5*).
These operations constitute the invocable interface functions for the
*Domain*.
A *Domain* is otherwise encapsulated and code generation will not
expose symbol names used in the domain's implementation.
A *Domain Operation* may also have *Domain Operation Parameter* (*R6*)
associated with it.
It is also typical for a *Domain* to have a set of *Type Alias* (*R7*).
A *Type Alias* provides a convenient way to map model type names onto
``C'' implementation types.

A *Class* may also have a set of *Operation* (*R3*).
An *Operation* may also have a set of *Operation Parameter* (*R4*).
A *Class* *Operation* may be class based or instance based,
the difference being that an instance based operation is invoked with
a reference to the class instance upon which the operation is to happen.

=== Domain

A domain is a real or imagined world with its own set of rules.

Name \{I}::
    Each domain in a system must have a unique name.
    Code generation will use the domain name to generate a component of
    the file system path name for the generated ``C'' files
    and the domain is prepended to external symbols to avoid
    name collisions.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: string
Interface::
    A Domain will, in general, have dependencies on other aspects of the
    system. The Interface attribute is a string that will be inserted
    in the generated interface header file for the domain.
    Typically, the Interface will contain `#include` ``C'' preprocessor
    statements, but may contain any other compiler declarations
    needed.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: string
Prologue::
    The Prologue for a Domain is inserted into the code file before any
    `micca` generated code.
    This gives the translation the opportunity to have external or forward
    references needed to satisfy the ``C'' compiler.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: string
Epilogue::
    The Epilogue for a Domain is inserted into the code file after any
    `micca` generated code.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: string
 
==== Implementation

[source,tcl]
----
<<micca configuration>>=
class Domain {
    attribute Name string -id 1\
        -check {[::micca::@Config@::Helpers::isIdentifier $Name]}
    attribute Interface string -default {}
    attribute Prologue string -default {}
    attribute Epilogue string -default {}
}
----

=== Domain Element

A domain element is one of the constituent parts of a domain.

Domain \{I,R1}::
    The name of the domain to which the element belongs.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: references Domain.Name
Name \{I}::
    Each domain elements is given a name that is unique within the domain.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: c-identifier

==== Implementation
[source,tcl]
----
<<micca configuration>>=
class DomainElement {
    attribute Domain string -id 1
    attribute Name string -id 1\
        -check {[::micca::@Config@::Helpers::isIdentifier $Name]}

    reference R1 Domain -link {Domain Name}
}
----

==== Checking for ``C'' Identifiers

Many names in the platform model will be directly used as an identifier in
the generated ``C'' code.
We insist they be of the correct form when the model is populated.
To be a proper identifier,
a name cannot be a keyword, must begin with an alphabetic character and
contain zero or more alphabetic, numeric or underscore characters.

[source,tcl]
----
<<helper data>>=
set keywords {_Bool _Complex _Imaginary auto break case char const
    continue default do double else enum extern float for goto if 
    inline int long register restrict return short signed sizeof static
    struct switch typedef union unsigned void volatile while}

<<helper commands>>=
proc isIdentifier {name} {
    variable keywords
    return [expr {[lsearch -sorted -exact $keywords $name] == -1 &&\
            [regexp {\A[[:alpha:]]\w*\Z} $name]}] ; # <1>
}
----
<1> The regular expression gibberish is just a translation of what
the narrative description says.

=== R1

* *Domain Element* is an entity of _exactly one_ *Domain*
* *Domain* models entities using _zero or more_ *Domain Element*

A domain is allowed to be empty of domain elements.
This is certainly not an extremely useful situation,
but we want to allow domain definitions to be cumulative.
Each element of a domain belongs strictly to a single domain,
_i.e._ domain elements are never shared between domains.

==== Implementation
[source,tcl]
----
<<micca configuration>>=
association R1 DomainElement 0..*--1 Domain
----

=== Class

A Class represents a logical predicate about some aspect of a Domain.

Domain \{I,I2,R2,R104}::
    The name of the domain to which the class belongs.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: References DomainElement.Domain
Name \{I,R2,R104}::
    Classes are identified by name within the domain to which they belong.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: string
Number \{I2}::
    It is useful during code generation to have a sequential integer number for
    classes within a given domain.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: zero based sequential numeric

==== Implementation
[source,tcl]
----
<<micca configuration>>=
class Class {
    attribute Domain string -id 1 -id 2
    attribute Name string -id 1 ; # <1>
    attribute Number int -id 2

    reference R2 DomainElement -link Domain -link Name
    reference R104 ValueElement -link Domain -link Name
}
----
<1> The question arises whether we need to check if *Class.Name* is a
valid ``C'' identifier.
The answer is no.
Since *Class.Name* refers to *DomainElement.Name* unconditionally,
the check on *DomainElement.Name* insures that *Class.Name* is a valid
``C'' identifier.
Otherwise, we would fail the referential integrity check indicated by *R2*.

=== Relationship

A Relationship represents a real world association between class instances.

Domain \{I,R2}::
    The name of the domain to which the relationsihp belongs.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: References DomainElement.Domain
Name \{I,R2}::
    Relationships are identified by name within the domain to which they belong.
    Traditionally, relationships are given names of the form, "R<digit>+", where
    <digit> is a decimal number.
    Although the convention is very commonly used in the executable modeling
    world, relationships may be given any valid ``C'' identifier.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: Refers to Domain Element.Name
Number \{I2}::
    It is useful during code generationto have a sequential integer number for
    relationships within a given domain.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: sequential numeric

==== Implementation
[source,tcl]
----
<<micca configuration>>=
class Relationship {
    attribute Domain string -id 1 -id 2
    attribute Name string -id 1
    attribute Number int -id 2 -system 0

    reference R2 DomainElement -link Domain -link Name
}
----

=== R2

* *DomainElement* is a *Class* or *Relationship*

There are only two types of domain elements, Classes and Relationships.
These elements model alone model the domain subject matter.

[source,tcl]
----
<<micca configuration>>=
generalization R2 DomainElement Class Relationship

=== Domain Operation

A Domain Operation is a executable body of code that provides
a service access point into a domain.
The set of domain operations of a domain constitute the invocable programming
interface to the domain.

Domain \{I,R5}::
    The name of the domain to which the domain operation belongs.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: refers to Domain.Name
Name \{I}::
    The name of the operation. Domain operations are given names that
    must be unique only within a given domain.
[horizontal]
    Data Type:::: c-identifier
Body::
    The code that is to be executed when the domain operation is invoked.
    This code is presumed to be ``C'' language statements and,
    except for some preprocessing of the statements,
    is passed along in the generated output file for the domain.
[horizontal]
    Data Type:::: c-code
ReturnDataType::
    The data type of the value returned by the domain operation.
[horizontal]
    Data Type:::: c-typename

==== Implementation
[source,tcl]
----
<<micca configuration>>=
class DomainOperation {
    attribute Domain string -id 1
    attribute Name string -id 1\
        -check {[::micca::@Config@::Helpers::isIdentifier $Name]}
    attribute Body string
    attribute ReturnDataType string\
        -check {[::micca::@Config@::Helpers::typeCheck verifyTypeName\
            $ReturnDataType]}

    reference R5 Domain -link {Domain Name}
}
----

=== R5

* *Domain Operation* is a service for _exactly one_ *Domain*
* *Domain* provides service via _zero or more_ *Domain Operation*

Domain operations only operate on a single domain.
However, a domain may not provide an explicit service entry points
and have no defined domain operations.

==== Implementation
[source,tcl]
----
<<micca configuration>>=
association R5 DomainOperation 0..*--1 Domain
----

=== Domain Operation Parameter

A Domain Operation may define a set of formal parameters.
When invoked,
the caller must supply an actual argument value for each formal parameter.

Domain \{I,I2,R6}::
    The name of the domain to which the parameter applies.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: refers to Domain Operation.Domain
Operation \{I,I2,R6}::
    The name of the domain operation to which the parameter applies.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: refers to Domain Operation.Name
Name \{I}::
    The name of the parameter.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: c-identifier
Number \{I2}::
    The ordinal position of the parameter when it is supplied as part
    of a list of other parameters.
    In addition to names,
    parameters are given a number as in many cases supplying
    arguments for formal parameters is accomplished in an ordered list
    without reference to the parameter name.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: numeric
DataType::
    The data type of the parameter.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: c-typename

==== Implementation
[source,tcl]
----
<<micca configuration>>=
class DomainOperationParameter {
    attribute Domain string -id 1 -id 2
    attribute Operation string -id 1 -id 2
    attribute Name string -id 1\
        -check {[::micca::@Config@::Helpers::isIdentifier $Name]}
    attribute Number int -id 2
    attribute DataType string\
        -check {[::micca::@Config@::Helpers::typeCheck verifyTypeName $DataType]}

    reference R6 DomainOperation -link Domain -link {Operation Name}
}
----

=== R6

* *Domain Operation Parameter* defines a formal parameter of _exactly one_
    *Domain Operation*
* *Domain Operation* has a formal parameter defined by _zero or more_
    *Domain Operation Parameter*

A domain operation parameter definition only applies to a single operation.
However, domain operations may have no parameters
as it is valid to have ``C'' functions with no parameters.

<<micca configuration>>=
association R6 DomainOperationParameter 0..*--1 DomainOperation
----

=== Constructor

A Constructor is a body of code that is invoked by the system when a
class instance is created.
Note that the constructor concept in `micca` is very simplified.
Constructors receive no arguments other than a reference to the
newly created class instance
nor is there any notion of a construction hierarchy with other classes.
The primary use for construction is to initialize attributes that have
some internal structure and represent a user defined data type.

Domain \{I,R8}::
    The name of the domain to which the constructor applies.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: refers to Class.Domain
Class \{I,R8}::
    The name of the class to which the constructor applies.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: refers to Class.Name
Body ::
    The body of the constructor. This is assumed to be ``C'' code.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: string

==== Implementation

<<micca configuration>>=
class Constructor {
    attribute Domain string -id 1
    attribute Class string -id 1
    attribute Body string

    reference R8 Class -link Domain -link {Class Name}
}
----

=== R8

* *Constructor* is an instance initializer for _exactly one_ *Class*
* *Class* initializes instances using _at most one_ *Constructor*

A class may have a constructor but is not required to.
Any constructor only operates on a single class.

==== Implementation
[source,tcl]
----
<<micca configuration>>=
association R8 Constructor 0..*--1 Class
----

=== Destructor

A Destructor is a body of code that is invoked by the system when a
class instance is destroyed.
The destructor is invoked with a reference to the class instance being
destroyed.
Like constructors,
the primary use for a destructor is to clean up resources or aggregate

Domain \{I,R9}::
    The name of the domain to which the destructore applies.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: refers to Class.Domain
Class \{I,R9}::
    The name of the class to which the destructore applies.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: refers to Class.Name
Body ::
    The body of the constructor. This is assumed to be ``C'' code.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: string

[source,tcl]
----
<<micca configuration>>=
class Destructor {
    attribute Domain string -id 1

=== Operation

An *Operation* is a executable body of code that computes on a
class or class instance.

Domain \{I,R3}::
    The name of the domain to which the operation belongs.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: refers to Class.Domain
Class \{I,R3}::
    The name of the class to which the operation belongs.
[horizontal]

    The name of the operation. Operations are given names that
    must be unique only within a given class.
[horizontal]
    Data Type:::: c-identifier
IsInstance::
    This attribute determine whether the operation applies to class instances.
    If true, then the generated code for the operation will have
    an implicitly declared parameter named `self`.
[horizontal]
    Data Type:::: boolean
Body::
    The code that is to be executed when the operation is invoked.

=== Operation Parameter

An Operation may define a set of formal parameters.
When invoked,
the caller must supply an actual argument value for each formal parameter.

Domain \{I,I2,R4}::
    The name of the domain to which the parameter applies.
[horizontal]

=== Type Alias

Typically, attributes in class models are given application specific
data types that reflect the value semantics of the attribute.
These must be mapped onto an implementation provided data type.
A Type Alias is just such a mapping.
In ``C'',
there are no mechanisms to implement a user defined data type.
What is provided is a simple alias scheme whereby a new name may be given
to a defined type.

    Data Type::: refers to Class.Domain
TypeName \{I}::

== Classes Subsystem

=== Introduction

[[classes-subsystem-discussion]]
The classes subsystem defines how model level ideas of a class will be
realized in `micca`.
We will simplify considerably the relational view of classes that
we find at the model level.
Because we are holding all data in memory and we are using
an implemenation language that exposes addresses,
there are number of simplifying transformations on classes available to us.

* Since the address in memory (_.i.e._ a pointer to an object) is unique,
we can use it as an identifier of each class instance.
If the identifying attributes from the model serve no other descriptive role,
then they can be eliminated altogether.
Using the object pointer as an identifier has a number of
other implementation benefits such as directly accessing attribute values.
* Referential attributes will be replaced by pointer values.
Since referential attributes always refer to identifiers in the model,
then implementing relationships can be accomplished by storing
sets of pointers whose values refer to objects in memory.

Both of these considerations lead to the decision,
common for platforms of the type `micca` is intended,
to map model level class definitions onto ``C'' structure definitions.
Storage for a class can then be allocated as an array of structures
that correspond to the class definition and
relationship information is stored as pointers into the instance arrays.
Most of the classes subsystem is concerned with how the ``C'' structure
definitions will be composed and the type of information that is held.
We will also be concerned with how some relationship storage will be
structured since there are choices that have different trade-offs.

Below is the UML class diagram for the domain subsystem of the platform model.

image::platform-classes.pdf[title="Classes Subsystem Class Diagram"]

A *Class* is composed of *ClassComponent* (*R20*).
*ClassComponent* consists of four different types (*R21*).
An *Attribute* is a named, descriptive value of the *Class* and may have
a *DefaultValue* (*R22*).
A *Reference* is used to implement class relationships.
A generalization subclass may be held as a discriminated union in
a *SubclassContainer*.
When a class instance participates in a multiple relationship that uses
linked lists,
the memory for the list linkage is held in a *LinkContainer*.
A *Reference* may also be one of four different types (*R23*).
The types of references fulfill different roles and types of relationships.
An *AssociationReference* is used to store information about
association relationships.
An *AssociatorReference* holds the references for an *AssociatorClass*.
A generalization supertype uses a *SubclassReference* to traverse a
generalization relationship from superclass to subclass.
A subtype uses a *SuperclassReference* to traverse a
generalization relationship from subclass to superclass.

=== Class Component

A Class Component is an element of the implementation class structure
and directly represents a member of the structure definition for the class
as it is used in the generated code.

Domain \{I,R20}::
    The name of the domain to which the class component belongs.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: Refers to Class.Domain
Class \{I,R20}::
    The name of the class to which the class component belongs.

}
----

=== R20

* *ClassComponent* defines the properties of _exactly one_ *Class*
* *Class* is characterized by _one or more_ *ClassComponent*

A Class is made up of one or more components and each component
can belong to only one class.
Empty classes are not allowed as these are deemed to model nothing.

[source,tcl]
----
<<micca configuration>>=
association R20 ClassComponent 1..*--1 Class
----

=== R21

* *ClassComponent* is an *Attribute*, *Reference* or *SubclassContainer*

There are four types of components that may be part of a class.
These four types represent the different ways attributes and relationships
are stored in class structures.
An attribute corresponds to a model level attribute that holds data
parameterizing the class
(_i.e._ attributes whose roles are descriptive and not strictly referential or
identifying).
A reference is one or more pointers that are used to implement
model level relationships.
A subclass container can be used by a superclass to hold subclass elements
as a discriminated union.
This is one option for how generalization relationship information may be
stored.
A link container is a set of pointers used to implement a linked list.
This is one option for how sets of relationship pointer information may be
stored.
The space for the link pointers is allocated in to the class that would be
chained together on a relationship.

=== Subclass Container

One option for storing generalization relationship information is
as a discriminated union.
The idea is that subclass storage is accomplished by creating a union
of all the subclasses in the generalization.
Then an component of the superclass is defined to be the subclasses union
along with another member to track to which subclass the superclass is
currently related.
This type of storage structure can save some memory space and
traversal across the generalization relationships can be accomplished
with pointer arithmetic.

to navigate from the superclass to one of its subclasses

In the case of a reflexive association,
that both reference directions are stored as a single component in the

== Relationship Subsystem [[relationship-subsystem]]

=== Mapping Referential Attributes to Pointers
When targeting a statically typed language such as ``C'' and assuming
that all class data will be held in primary memory,
we must devise a way to map relational notions of referential attributes
and referential integrity onto ``C''' language constructs.
There are, needless to say, many ways this can be done.
As we discussed earlier,
we make the convenient decision to use the address of a class instance
as an architecturally supplied identifier.
This decision has many benefits in the implementation.
This also means we can store pointer values as a means of implementing
relationships.

Consider a many-to-one association between two classes.
In a relational scheme,
we would have referential attributes in the class that was on the *many*
side of the relationship and the values of those attributes would
match the values of identifying attributes on the *one* side.
In a pointer based scheme we can do the same thing, _i.e._
place a pointer variable in the ``C'' structure of the class on the *many* side
and have the value of the pointer match that of a class instance on
the *one* side.
The diagram below shows this mapping.

image::pointer-example.pdf[title="Direct Mapping of Referential Attribute"]

Now lets look at the computation required to navigate this relationship,
first from the many side to the one side and then from the one side to
the many side.
For this discussion we will assume the relationship is unconditional on
both sides.

From the many side,
we can see from the above diagram that given a pointer to an *A* instance
we can navigate to the related *B* instance by simply accessing the
`R1` member of `struct A`.
When navigating from the one side to the many side,
we will, in general, obtain more than one instance as a result of the
navigation.
We can find those instances by searching all of the many-side instances
selecting those instances who have a stored pointer value that matches the
address of the one-side class instance.
So in our example, if we have a pointer to a `struct B` we would need to
search all instances of *A* looking for those where the `R1` member
matched the value of our starting `struct B` pointer.

Having to perform a search for the one-side to many-side navigation is
somewhat troubling.
If the number of instances of the many-side class is small,
then there is little concern.
If it is larger, then we might explore ways to avoid costs associated
with a straight linear search of the many-side instances.
The search code is also rather inconvenient since we target a statically
typed language.
The function to iterate across the many-side instances looking for
the one-side pointer value has to be specific to that particular relationship
if we are to be strictly type safe and don't want to resort to
extremes of type casting and pointer arithmetic.

One way to avoid the search altogether is to store the pointers of the
multiple related instances.
We will have, in effect, pre-computed the related set and, at the cost of the
pointer storage, incur no run time computation to find it.
The figure below shows this in sketch form.

image::pointer-set-example.pdf[title="Mapping Instance References in Both Directions"]

In this arrangement,
the multiple instances implied by traversing the *R1* relationship from
class *B* to class *A* is held as an array of pointers to the related
*A* instances.

It does take computation to maintain the set if the instances participating
in the relationship change.
The space vs. speed trade-off is such that we will always use some
additional space to save a run time cost and additional code associated with
computing a set of related instances.
There are other choices of data structures that could be used
to hold the set of pointers.
By choosing different data structures to store the pointer sets,
we can, again at the cost of some additional space,
make maintaining the related pointer sets easier in the face of relationship
changes.

So we adopt the strategy to store relationship pointers that implement
the navigation in both participating classes.
This decision will also be helpful when we discuss referential integrity
checking and transactions on the data model.

Analysis like that above can be applied to the other types of relationships
and pointer storage schemes can be designed that map the
relational notion of referential attributes to memory pointers.
Most of the relationship subsystem is concerned with categorizing
the types of relationships from a model level
and mapping those onto the roles the classes play in the relationship.
This will then allows us to explicitly map the role a class plays in a
relationship to the kind of storage required to implement that role and
further to the class structure components that are required to hold
the pointers.
The references subsystem models this later part.

=== Naming Conventions on Relationship Traversal

[[relationship-naming-conventions]]
In addition to modeling the real world associations between classes,
relationships also provide a means for the processing of the domain
to navigate the class diagram to access related class instances.
Here we discuss the syntax conventions we will use to indicate
how this navigation will take place.
We adopt the strategy that each relationship has a designated _direction_.
Navigating in the _forward direction_ starts with instances of a source
class and ends with instances of a target class.
Navigating in the _reverse direction_ starts with target class instances
and ends with source class instances.
To designate the forward direction we will use the unadorned relationship
name, _e.g._ `R22` and the reverse direction is indicated by
placing a tilde character before the relationship name, _e.g._ `~R22`.
The motivation behind this convention is to minimize the amount
of specification that needs to be given for navigating relationships
and to disambiguate the case of a reflexive relationship where the
source class and target class are the same.
Given the specification of a relationship direction,
the system knows which classes are involved and that detail need not be
restated when specifying the navigation.
When specifying a direction to a relationship there are three cases to
consider.

For simple assocations,
the forward direction of the relationship is from the referring class
to the referenced class.
In a simple association,
one class contains referential attributes and is hence the referring class.
The other class contains the referenced identifying attributes and
is deemed the referenced class.
The forward direction is then the traversal from instances of the
referring class to instances of the referenced class.

For generalization relationships,
the forward direction of the relationship is also from the referring class
to the referenced class.
In a generalization,
the subclass instances are always the referring instances.
Navigating from the superclass to a subclass requires additional information,
namely which subclass is to be the target.
Navigating from a superclass instance to a subclass instance can yield
at most one subclass instance and possibly zero if the superclass instance
is not actually related to the requested subclass.
So the syntax convention to navigate from a superclass instance to a subclass
instance specifies navigating in the reverse direction as well as the
desired subclass name, _e.g._ `~R42 TableLamp`.

For class based associations,
it is the associator class that holds referential attributes that refer to
both participating classes.
In this case,
the forward direction of the relationships must simply be specified
and one class is designated the source and the other the target.
Since it is also possible to navigate from a participating class to the
associator class itself,
we will specify that case by including the associator class name,
similar to the way generalization relationship navigation is specified.
Navigating from source to target is specified as the unadorned
relationship name, _e.g._ `R14`.
Navigating from target to source uses the tilde notation, _e.g._ `~R14`.
Navigating from the source to the associator includes the associator
class name, _e.g._ `R14 Ownership` and from target to associator
uses the tilde and the associator class name, _e.g._ `~R14 Ownership`.

Only associations can be reflexive (_i.e._ the source and target are the
same class).
For generalization relationships,
we insist that all the subclasses are distinct and that they are distinct
from the superclass.
The conventions used here serve to disambiguate association traversal
in the reflexive case,
however, additional specification is required to fix the precise traversal
path for the case of one-to-one and many-to-many reflexive relationships.
For a one-to-one reflexive association,
we will need to specify which attributes are the referential ones and
that will set the direction.
For a many-to-many association an associator class is required and
again we will have to specify the path from source to target.

Below is the UML class diagram for the relationship subsystem of the platform
model.

image::platform-relation.pdf[title="Relationship Subsystem Class Diagram"]

There are two types of *Relationship* (*R30*), namely
*Association* and *Generalization*.
In turn,
there are two types of *Association* (*R31*), namely
*Simple Association* and *Class Based Association*.
A *Class Based Association* uses a distinct *Associator Class* (*R42*)
to hold references to the participating *Source Class* (*R34*) and
*Target Class* (*R35*).
A *Simple Association* is one where the multiplicity and conditionality
are such that all the references can be located in one of the participating
classes.
The *Simple Referring Class* houses the references (*R32*) while the
*Simple Referenced Class* is the one referred to (*R33*).
`Micca` supports two ways to handle generalization relationships (*R43*).
A *Reference Generalization* uses pointer values to implement the
relationship.
In this arrangement,
a *Referenced Superclass* (*R36*) holds a pointer and encoded type to
a *Referring Subclass* (*R37*).
The *Referring Subclass* also holds a pointer to its related superclass
instances.
A *Union Generalization* uses a discriminated union
to implement the relationship.
This leads to the complementary ideas of a *Union Superclass* (*R44*) and
a *Union Subclass* (*R45*).
All of these class roles are specialized as a *Class Role* (*R40*) which
is the many-to-many-to-many correlation between *Relationship* and
*Class* (*R41*).

=== Association
An Association is a mapping between the instances of two classes.
The two classes need not be distinct.
If the association is between instances of the same class,
then it is called a _reflexive_ association.
If the association is between instances of distinct classes,
then it is called a _non-reflexive_ association.

In a Simple Association between two classes,

A *Simple Association* is one where referential attributes are
placed in one of participating class that refer to the identifying
attributes of the other class.
The class containing the referenced identifying attributes serves
the role of a *Simple Referenced Class*.
Each *Simple Association* must have a class that acts as
a *Simple Referenced Class* and a class can only be a *Simple Referenced Class*

=== Conventions Used for Class Based Associations
[[class-base-association-conventions]]
Class based association pose some additional complexity when
describing the way in which they are mapped to the implementation realm.
The associator class represents instances of the association between
the participants.
Each instance of the associator class corresponds one-to-one to instances
of the association itself.
As we discussed
<<relationship-naming-conventions,above>>,
in a class based association one participant will be deemed the source
and the other the target in order to specify the direction of the
relationship for traversal.
The associator class itself always contains the referential attributes
and in our implementation strategy, will contain two pointers, one each
to the participating class instances.
The pointer values will never be `NULL` as the reference from the
associator class to one of the participants is always unconditional.
We will decompose a class based association to make the role of the
associator class explicit.
This is shown in the diagram below.

image::assoc-decompose.pdf[title="Decomposition of Class Based Associations"]

Note that as part of the decomposition,
the multiplicity and conditionality of the source and target sides have
been switched.
Because the references from the associator class to the participants is
unconditional,
the multiplicity and conditionality of the decomposed association when going
from the source class to the associator class is the same as that specified
for the target side at the model level and conversely for the target class.
The apparent switch of the multiplicity and conditionality results from
both the decomposition,
which makes the role of the associator class and its pointer references
explicit,
and the unconditional nature of the references from the associator class to the
participant classes.

With this in mind,
we describe the roles that classes play in a class based association below.
We will have occasion to refer back to this explanation when we generate
the code for class based associations.

=== Source Class

For a Class Based Association,
the Source Class is the starting class from which the association can be
traversed in the forward direction.

=== Target Class

For a Class Based Association,

in the forward direction starting at the Source Class, the instances
related by the association are found.
Alternatively, the Target Class can serve as the start of a traversal
of the association in the reverse direction.

=== Class Role

A Class Role is an abstraction of the various ways that classes may
participate in relationships.
The major concept in the relationship subsystem is to define the
various types of relationships and then abstract the way that classes
participate in the relationships and the roles they play in holding
referential attributes, etc.

    There are three roles available to a class.
    It may be a _source_, _target_ or _associator_.
    Note that the Role attribute is part of the identifier of the class.
    This accounts for reflexive associations where the same class
    will play two different roles in the association.

*Relationship*

Classes may participate in relationships to model the real world
associations between the classes.
It is possible (but not usual) for a class not to participate in any
relationship.
Relationships alway involve the participation of one or more classes
(usually two or three).
Note that *Class Role* has an additional identifying attribute, *Role*,
so that *R41* is actually a many-to-many-to-many association.
This additional multiplicity is required since reflexive relationships
have the same class playing more than one role in the relationship.

== References Subsystem

=== Introduction

In the Relationship subsystem,
we say how the platform models relationships and how classes play a
role in realizing the relationship.
In the References subsystem,
we map the roles a class plays in realizing a relationship to the
components that the class instances must store.
This mapping joins back with the Class Components seen in the
Classes subsystem

Below is the UML class diagram for the references subsystem of the platform
model.

=== R90

* *Association Participant Class* holds references in _exactly one_
*Directional Reference*
* *Directional Reference* is a reference holder for _one or more_
*Association Participant Class*

When a class serves as an Association Participant Class it may hold
pointer references to the other class in the association.
Directional References hold pointer information for each direction
of the association traversal.
For reflexive associations,
this will result in two Directional Reference instances for the same
class.
For non-reflexive associations,
there is only one Directional Reference for the relationship.

* *Union Superclass* stores subclass instances in _exactly one_

*Union Superclass*

The use of a discriminated union to store associated subclass instances
in a superclass instance memory structure eliminates the need for
various reference pointers.
The Union Superclass stores the currently related subclass instance
in the Subclass Container that can be used to disinguish the type of 
the related subclass.

== State Model Subsystem

=== Introduction

The class, relationship and reference subsystems describe how model level
concepts of classes and relationships are mapped to implementation level
concepts of structures and pointers.
In the state model subsystem we turn our attention to the dynamics
and sequencing of execution of the model.

The classes in the state model subsystem capture the essential information
of a Moore type state model along with the XUML conventions of how
to specify ignored and error transitions.
The sequencing of execution via dispatch of state machine events is
handled by the run time mechanisms of `micca`.
The run time is completely data driven.
So our focus in the platform model is to capture that data needed to
generate the data structures used by the run time mechanisms.
The implications of this are that the state model subsystem is relatively
platform independent.
There are no particular ``C'' language implications of dispatching events
to state machines since the there is no particular ``C'' language
constructs specific to state machines.
The run time mechanisms must supply all the logic around event dispatch.
We will find it convenient to include some sequential numeric attributes
since the run time will use array data structures to access some types
of information and we would like a rather direct way of computing
appropriate array indices.

Below is the UML class diagram for the state model subsystem of the platform
model.

image::platform-statemodel.pdf[title="State Model Subsystem Class Diagram"]

A *State Model* is of one of two types (*R50*),
an *Instance State Model* or an *Assigner State Model*.
An *Instance State Model* is associated with a *Class* (*R51*) and an
*Assigner State Model* is associated with an *Association* relationship (*R52*).
Both types of state models operate the same.
They contain a set of *States* (*R55*) and possibly a *Creation State* (*R56*).
A *State Model* has a default *Transition Rule* (*R59*) to resolve
unspecified transitions and an initial state (*R58*) to know where things
start.
All the *States* and the *Creation State* constitute a *State Place* where
the state model can transition when it has an event dispatched to it (*R57*).
An *Assigner State Model* also consists of two types (*R53*),
*Single Assigner* and *Multiple Assigner*.
A *Single Assigner* has only a single instance while a
*Multiple Assigner* has a many instances as the *Class* that
partitions is behavior (*R54*).

=== State Model

A State Model is a finite automaton, specifically a Moore type state machine.
A State Model is used to define the sequencing of execution for the
lifecycle of its assocated class or assigner.
The State Model defines behavior that is common to all of the associated
instances or assigners and each class instance or assigner instance has its own
notion of its current state.

* *State Model* is sync created in _exactly one_ *State*
* *State* is the sync creation place for _at most one_ *State Model*

When an entity that has an associated State Model is create synchronously,
it is placed in an initial state.
No state activity is run as part of the synchronous creation.
Not all States of a State Model serve the role of being the default
initial state.

When specifying the state transitions for a state model,
not all transitions must be specified explicitly.
Those transition not explicitly specified are are give the value of
a Transition Rule.
Since there multiple Transition Rules, any given Transition Rule may not be
used as a default transition for a State Model.

=== Instance State Model

An Instance State Model is that type of state model associated with the
lifecycle of a class instance.

----

=== R51

* *Instance State Model* describes the lifecycle of _exactly one_ *Class*
* *Class* lifecycle is described by _at most one_ *Instance State Model*

An Instance State Model is the definition of the lifecycle behavior
for only one class but not all classes will exhibit lifecycle behavior and
so may not have an Instance State Model.

<<micca configuration>>=
association R51 InstanceStateModel 0..1--1 Class

=== Assigner State Model

An Assigner State Model is that type of state model associated with the
lifecycle of an association relationship.
Sometimes the semantics of the domain subject matter are such that
forming and breaking an association must be serialized.
The archetypical example is where the association is competitive
and parallel activity could create incorrect association linkages.

behavior and so may not have an Assigner State Model.

=== State

A State is one of the components of a State Model.
States have a name that is disctinct among the other states of the State Model
and have an executable activity that is run by the system when the
state is entered upon a transition.

Domain \{I,R55,R57,R78}::
    The domain in which the state resides.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: Refers to State Model.Domain, State Place.Domain

}
----

=== R55

* *State* is an active element of _exactly one_ *State Model*
* *State Model* acts via _one or more_ *State*

A State is part of only a single State Model.
Sharing states between state models is not allowed.
Every State Model must have at least one state.
The notion of an empty state model does not carry any behavior which it
the purpose of a state model.

----

=== Creation State

When a entity that has an associated State Model is created
asynchonously by a creation event,
it is placed in a pseudo-initial state.
The creation event is then dispatched to the instance, causing a
transition to a real state and the consequent execution of the
destination state activity.
The Creation State is the state the instance resides in temporarily
until the creation event is dispatched.
It differs from an ordinary state in that it can have no activity
associated with it and can only have out-bound transitions
(_i.e._ you cannot transition into a Creation State).

Domain \{I,R56,R57}::
    The domain in which the creation state resides.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: Refers to State Model.Domain and State Place.Domain
Model \{I,R56,R57}::
    The name of the state model to which the creation state belongs.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: Refers to State Model.Model and State Place.Model
Name \{I,R57}::
    The name of the creation state.
    Since a State Model may have at most one Creation State (by R56)
    and since a Creation State does not result in creating any
    ``C'' language identifiers, we choose a distinctive name for
    the Creation State that is outside of the domain for ordination
    state names.
    It suffices to choose the literal string ``@''
    to distinguish the Creation State.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: the literal string ``@''

    attribute Name string -id 1

    reference R56 StateModel -link Domain -link Model
    reference R57 StatePlace -link Domain -link Model -link Name
}
----

=== R56

A State Model may have at most one Creation State and that Creation State
is unique to a given State Model.
Not all State Models have creation events defined for them, _i.e._
not all Classes support asynchronous creation.

=== State Place

A State Place is an abstract location from which an event transition may
occur.

Domain \{I,I2}::
    The domain in which the state place resides.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: string
Model \{I,I2}::
    The name of the state model to which the state place belongs.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: string
Name \{I}::
    The name of the state place.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: Union of State.Name and Creation State.Name
Number \{I2}::
    A sequential number given to the state place to aid in the encoding
    of states required during code generation.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: sequential numeric

<<micca configuration>>=
class StatePlace {
    attribute Domain string -id 1 -id 2
    attribute Model string -id 1 -id 2
    attribute Name string -id 1
    attribute Number string -id 2
}
----

=== R57

* *State Place* is a *State* or *Creation State*

State transitions can originate from either a State or a Creation State.
 
==== Implementation

generalization R57 StatePlace State CreationState
----

=== Transition Rule

The execution rules for XUML state models allow for two types of
transition specifications that do not actually cause a transition in
a state machine.
These rules simplify the specification of state models.
One transition rule states that an event is to be ignored in a state
and is named, ``IG''.
The other transition rule states that it is a logical impossiblity for
the event to be received in the state and is named, ``CH''
(for ``can't happen'').

Name \{I}::
    The name of the transition rule.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: {IG, CH}
 
==== Implementation

[source,tcl]
----
<<micca configuration>>=
class TransitionRule {
    attribute Name string -id 1 -check {$Name in {IG CH}}
}
----

The number of Transition Rule instances is well known and constant
so we will specify them here.

[source,tcl]
----
<<micca population>>=
class TransitionRule    {
    Name                } {
    IG
    CH
}
----

=== R53

* *Assigner State Model* is a *Single Assigner* or *Multiple Assigner*

When an association has an Assigner State Model,
it may exist as a singleton or it may have multple instances of the
assigner.
 
==== Implementation
[source,tcl]
----
<<micca configuration>>=
generalization R53 AssignerStateModel SingleAssigner MultipleAssigner
----

=== Single Assigner

A Single Assigner is a type of Assigner State Model that is used
when a competitive association must be serialized through one
execution path.
This is the most frequent case.

Domain \{I,R53}::
    The domain in which the single assigner resides.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: Refers to Assigner State Model.Domain
Association \{I,R53}::
    The name of the association relationship for which the single assigner
    operates.

class SingleAssigner {
    attribute Domain string -id 1
    attribute Association string -id 1

    reference R53 AssignerStateModel -link Domain -link Association
}
----

=== Multiple Assigner

A Multiple Assigner is a type of Assigner State Model that is used
when a competitive association is partitioned into distinct subsets
wherein the assignment of the association is made.

Domain \{I,R53,R54}::
    The domain in which the multiple assigner resides.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: Refers to Assigner State Model.Domain
    and Class.Domain
Association \{I,R53}::
    The name of the association relationship for which the multiple assigner
    operates.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: Refers to Assigner State Model.Association
Class \{R54}::
    The name of the class whose instances partition the multiple assigner.

    reference R54 Class -link Domain -link {Class Name}
    reference R104 ValueElement -link Domain -link {Association Name}
}
----

=== R54

* *Multiple Assigner* is partitioned by _exactly one_ *Class*
* *Class* partions instance of _zero or more_ *Multple Assigner*

A Multiple Assigner operates on association instances that are divided
into sets associated with the instance of some Class.
Not all Classes partition Multiple Assigners.
The archetypical example of a Multiple Assigner is where a clerk
services customers but the clerk only services customers who are shopping
in the department where the clerk works.
In this case the department serves to partition the assignment of
clerks to customers to insure that assignments occur within the context
of the department in which the clerk works.

== Event Subsystem

=== Introduction
The Event subsystem is concerned with classifying events that drive
state machine transitions.
The complexity here is that the execution rules for XUML allow for
one form of polymorphism, namely polymorphic events.

A polymorphic event can arise only in the context of a generalization
relationship.
Events can be designated as polymorphic and when such an event is
signaled to a superclass instance,
it is mapped at run time to an event in the subclass instance that
is currently related to superclass instance.
The net effect is to allow the subclasses of a generalization all to respond to
the same events and yet the events are signaled to the superclass instances of
the generalization.
This aleviates the burden on the signalling class to determine the
subclass instance to which the superclass instance is currently related.

Strictly speaking event polymorphism is an optimization performed by the run
time mechanisms since mapping an event to a subclass could be performed as part
of the state activity.
However, such code is repetitive and rather fragile in the wake of
adding or deleting subclasses in a generalization.
This is a case where the system can ``know'' the right thing to do
and remove a significant burden from the model level processing.

In its most common usage,
polymorphic events are quite straight forward.
Events are designated as polymorphic by the superclass and
they are used as transitioning events by the state models of the subclasses.
In its most general usage however,
we must account for both repeated generalization (_i.e._ where a subclass
serves as the superclass for a futher generalization) and
compound generalization (_i.e._ where a class is the superclass for
multiple generalization relationships).
The full set of rules and implications of polymorphic events can be rather
daunting.

* Associating polymorphic events with a superclass does _not_ imply
that the superclass has no state behavior of its own.
A superclass may have both a state model and polymorphic events since
generating a polymorphic event to a superclass does not result in any
behavior in the superclass.
* A given superclass may be the superclass of multiple generalizations.
In this case, generating an event to an instance of such a superclass
will cause an event to be generated to all generalizations for which
the class is a superclass.
In this way, signalling a single event may result in multiple events being
dispatched.
* The state model for a subclass may respond to
transitioning events that are not part of the polymorphic event set associated
with the generalization.
Such events may be signalled directly to instances of the subclass
or they may be signalled by a subclass instance itself.
* A class that is a subclass may also be a superclass of another generalization,
_i.e._ a subclass may be subject to repeated generalization.
Such a mid-level class may designate additional polymorphic events associated
with the generalization relationship for which it is the superclass.
Also a mid-level class may delegate polymorphic events associated with its
subclass role to any hierarchy for which it serves as a superclass.
* A mid-level class may have a state model that consumes an inherited
polymorphic event.
In that case,
the event is not inherited down any other generalization for which
the mid-level class is a superclass.
* All leaf classes, _i.e._ subclasses which are _not_
the superclass of another generalization,
must consume as transitioning events all polymorphic events delegated to them.
It is sufficient to ignore an event or deem an event as can't happen, but
polymorphic events are mapped ultimately to transitioning events when
the bottom of the generalization hierarchy is reached.

Note also that generalizations are _not_ subject to the so called
``diamond'' construct where a given class is a subclass of multiple
generalizations which themselves have a common superclass ancestor.
Blessedly,
referential integrity simply does not allow such a beast to be constructed.

These rules give rise to the following class model for state model events.

image::platform-event.pdf[title="Event Subsystem Class Diagram"]

An *Event* can be of two types (*R80*), either a *Deferred Event* or a
*Transitioning Event*.
A *Transitioning Event* actually causes state transition in a *State Model*
(*R87*).
A *Deferred Event* arises from a *Superclass* across a *Deferral Path* (*R86*).
Because of *R80*,
transitioning events and polymorphic events in a superclass must have different
names.
We do consider this an advantage in avoiding confusion between polymorphic
events and transitioning events in the superclass.
A *Transitioning Event* is either a *Local Event* or a *Mapped Event* (*R82*).
A *Local Event* is specified directly by a state model and a
*Mapped Event* is a deferred event as it is consumed in a state model (*R84*).
A *Deferred Event* is either a *Polymorphic Event* defined directly by
a superclass or is delegated as an *Inherited Event*
from another generalization for which the class was a subclass.
Both an *Inherited Event* or a *Mapped Event* are forms of
*Non-Local Event* (*R83*) and a *Non-Local Event* may only be defined
to act upon a *Subclass* (*R85*).

=== R80

* *Event* is a *Deferred Event* or *Transitioning Event*

There are two types of events.
Those that cause an immediate effect on a state model are
*Transitioning Events*.
Those that are mapped at run time to an event in a subclass are
*Deferred Events*.
The execution rules do not allow for any other types of events.
Note that a creation event is just another form of *Transitioning Event*.
The only difference is that the run time mechanism creates the
class instance immediately before dispatching the creation event to it.

* *Deferred Event* is a *Polymorphic Event* or *Inherited Event*

There are two source of events that are deferred.
Deferral happens in the sense that the events do not affect the behavior of the
superclass to which they are sent.
A superclass may declare an event as polymorphic or a
subclass of a generalization may choose to not act upon the event
if it is also the superclass of a different generalization.
In the later case,
the event not acted upon is inherited by the subclasses.

Event polymorphism allows an event in a Superclass to be deferred

Not all Superclasses define polymorphic events.
A given polymorphic event may be propagated along mulitple generalization
relationships in the case of a compound generalization,
_i.e._ a superclass that is the a superclass for multiple generalizations.

Second, the event could have been deferred from a superclass and
when it dispatched to a subclass is mapped into an event defined
for the subclass.

by the definition of a state machine.

=== Polymorphic Event

A polymorphic event is an event defined for the superclass of a generalization
that is to be mapped at run time to an event of one of the subclasses
of the generalization.
The run time mapping determines the subclass to which the superclass is
currently related and maps the event into one by the same name in the
subclass.

=== Inherited Event

A polymorphic event defined for superclass becomes an inherited
event in the subclasses of the generalization if a subclass does not
act upon the polymorphic event.
This can occur when the subclass is part of a repeated generalization
where it serves the role of subclass in a generalization that defines
the polymorphic event and serves the role of superclass in another
generalization.
The event can be thought of as being inherited down the hierarchy formed
by the repeated generalizations.

When a deferred event is consumed, it becomes a mapped event in the
subclass where it is acted upon.
A mapped event always starts out as one that is deferred from a superclass.
Not all deferred events are necessarily mapped.
It is possible to defer an event through muliple generalizations before it
is finally consumed and becomes a mapped event.

== Transition Subsystem

=== Introduction

The transition subsystem is concerned with the dispatch of state model
events.
The type of dispatch supported by XUML is the same as for a Moore type
state machine,
_i.e._ for a given state an event causes a transition into a new state
(not necessarily distinct from the current state) and executes any activity
associated with the state.
In UML parlance, these are known as entry actions.
No other form of action dispatch is supported as it is not needed.

One other complexity of state activity dispatch is that event arguments.
Each state may define a signature of parameters that the state activity
expects.
It is a corollary of Moore state machines that any event that causes
a transition _into_ a state must carry arguments that match the
formal parameter signature of the state.

The diagram below shows the transition subsystem classes.

image::platform-transition.pdf[title="Transition Subsystem Class Diagram"]

All the *State Places* and *Transitioning Events* combine to form a
transition matrix (*R70*) the cells of which are represented by
*Transition Places*.
There are two types of transitions that can occur in an state model (*R71*).
A *State Transition* causes the state machine to enter a new state
of the state model (*R72*).
A *Non-State Transition* does not cause a new state to be entered but
has the side effect of either ignoring the event or causing a system error
(*R73*).

When a state transition happens,
the arguments carried by the event are transferred to the state
activity according to the *Argument Signature* (*R74*).
An *Argument Signature* correponds to a set of positional parameters (*R75*)
which have a fixed position in the argument list and a defined data type.
Each *State* and *Event* may have an *Parameter Signature* (*R78* and *R69*)
A *Parameter Signature* gives names to the positional parameters.
The *Parameter Signature* for events causing a transition into a
state must match the underlying *Argument Signature* of the
*State Transition* (*R76*)
A *State* or *Event* may name its parameters in any way it wishes (*R79*)
but the names do not affect the underlying position or data type of
a *Argument Signature* (*R77*).
The only thing important about the arguments of a state activity are the
position and data type, as is required by ``C'' when invoking a function.
The parameter naming from the *State* and *Event* points of view need
not be the same.

=== Transition Place

The Cartesian product of the state of a state model and the events of
the model form a conceptual transition matrix.
A transition place models the individual cells of the conceptual transition
matrix.

=== R72

* *State Transition* is destined for _exactly one_ *State*

When an event is dispatched and it causes a transition,
a new state becomes the current state.
This must happen for every state transition.
Conversely, not all states are the destination of a transition.
Some state may only have outbound transitions.

action.

=== R73

* *Non-State Transition* has the effect of _exactly one _*Transition Rule*
* *Transition Rule* describes the effect for _zero or more _
*Non-State Transition*

All transitions that do not result in a new state being entered must
take an action that is dictated by transitions rules that govern
non-state transitions.
Any given transition rule may not be applied to a non-state transition.

=== Argument Signature

A State can define formal parameters for its activity.
The set of those parameters form a signature for the state.
Any event that causes a transition into a given state must carry
argument values that match the formal parameters of the state,
_i.e._ the event can be considered to have the same signature as the
state into which it causes a transition.

Domain \{I}::
    The domain in which the argument signature resides.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: string
ASigID \{I}::
    The identifier of the argument signature.
    Argument signatures are identified uniquely within a given domain.
    This choice of identification is somewhat arbitrary and this particular
    choice is an attempt to keep the signature information localized to
    a particular domain.

}
----

=== R74

* *State Transition* transfers argument values by _at most one_
*Argument Signature*
* *Argument Signature* defines argument transfer for _one or more_
*State Transition*

The parameters of the state activity constitute its signature.
A state may have no signature if it has no parameters.
Within a given model,
several states may have the same signature.
This allows an event to have the same signature but cause a transition
to different states.

==== Implementation
[source,tcl]
----
<<micca configuration>>=
association R74 StateTransition 0..*--0..1 ArgumentSignature
----

*R74* is _not_ an independent relationship.
It is constrained by the requirement that the Argument Signature associated
with both the new state of a transition and the event that causes
a transition must be the same.
We insist that:

* R74 = R72 + R78 + R76
* R74 = R71 + R70 + R80 + R69 + R76

In other words,
both the Argument Signatures of the New State of a State Transition and
that of the Event that causes the transiton must be the same.
To enforce that constraint,
we write a TclRAL procedural constraint on the State Transition
class.

Matching argument signatures for a state transition is one of the more
complicated aspects of the platform model.
We define the procedural constraint below that will insure that the
two constaints are enforced.
We must also print any error messages as part of the procedural constraint,
because after the constraint fails, the configuration classes (relvars)
will have been rolled back to their previous values.

Procedural constraints are not directly supported by `rosea`,
so we have to fall back to TclRAL commands to implement it.
The strategy is to compute the argument signature directly across *R74*
and then compare that result with those obtained from the
relationship composition equations above.
If there is a mismatch,
then we determine which transitions are causing the problem.

=== Parameter Signature

An state activity may require a set of parameters when it is invoked.
Those parameters may have arbitrary names, but for the implementation
to operate correctly,
the order of a parameter and its data type, not its name, govern
whether or not a set of event arguments matches a set of state activity
parameters.
A Parameter Signature is a way for states and events to name
parameters as they wish, but still have a way to determine if the
arguments match the formal parameters.

== Population Subsystem

=== Introduction
The Population subsystem is concerned with defining the
initial data values that class instances will have when the domain starts
running and to specifying the storage characteristics for classes.
In a `micca` generated system,
there is no dynamic memory allocation and all class storage is specified
at compile time.
Many domains have substantial initial instance populations and
`micca` provides a way to specify those populations.
When the code is generated,
inital instances become initializers in the array where a class is stored.
One goal of managing the initial instance population is to avoid
having to write executable code that creates the instances.
Such code is run only once,
and for platforms targeted by `micca`,
code space for code that is only run once needs to be minimized.
We can take advantage of initialized variables in ``C'' to have
data values placed in the proper variables when the system is started.

image::platform-population.pdf[title="Population Subsystem Class Diagram"]

A *Population* is a collection of initial data values for a *Domain* (*R100*).
Only certain *Value Element* components in a *Domain* can be supplied
with initial values.
A *Value Element* is one of two types (*R104*), either a *Class* or a
*Multiple Assigner*.
A *Population* must consist of an *Element Population* for each
*Value Element* (*R101*).
Reflecting the two different types of *Value Elements*,
there are two different types of *Element Populations* (*R105*).
A *Class Population* contains *Class Instances* (*R102*) and an
*Assigner Population* contains *Multiple Assigner Instances* (*R107*).
A *Class Population* can be a *Dynamic Class Population* or a
*Static Class Population* (*R109*).
A *Dynamic Class Population* parameterizes the amount of space allocated to
store instances.
A *Static Class Population* is where the number of instance is determined by
the initial instance population.
A *Static Class Population* also has the property that it can be
constant and placed in read only memory if it has no dynamic behavior at all.
A *Class Instance* defines values for *Class Components* (*R103*)
and this will include values for both attributes and references.
A *Multiple Assigner Instance* is always an instance for a *Multiple Assigner*
(*R106*).
A *Multiple Assigner Instance* is also always associated with the
*Class Instance* of the identifying class for the multiple assigner (*R108*).

=== Population

A Population is a named set of instance values for a Domain.

Name \{I}::
    The name of the population. Population names need only be unique
    within the context of a domain.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: string
Domain \{I,R100}::
    The domain for which the population defines values.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: Refers to Domain.Name

==== Implementation

[source,tcl]
----
<<micca configuration>>=
class Population {
    attribute Name string -id 1
    attribute Domain string -id 1

    reference R100 Domain -link {Domain Name}
}
----

=== R100

* *Population* supplies initial data values for _exactly one_ *Domain*
* *Domain* has initial data values specified by _zero or more_ *Population*

A Population always applies to a single domain.
It is possible to define a Domain without giving a population.
This allows domain definitions to be reused with many different populations
for testing and deployment purposes.
However, code generation insists that there be a population for the domain.

=== Value Element

A Value Element is an entity in a domain that can be supplied population values.

Domain \{I}::
    The domain to which the value element belongs.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: string
Name \{I}::
    The name of the value element.

=== R104

* *Value Element* is a *Class* or *Multiple Assigner*

There are two types of entities in a domain that can be supplied
inital values, namely a Class or a Multiple Assigner.
All other entities of a domain do not have any value semantics.

=== R101

* *Element Population* is an instance of
*Population* supplies initial data values for _one or more_ *Value Element*
* *Element Population* is an instance of

A Population supples the values for Value Elements.
All Value Elements should be supplied population values.
A Value Element may exist independent of a Population so that a domain
may be defined separately from any population.

Class \{I,R102}::
    The name of the class to which the class population applies.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: Refers to Element Population.Element
Allocation::
    The number instances of the class which is allocated beyond storage
    required for the instances specified by the population.
    The space for instance storage will consist of that specified in the
    initial instance population plus the value of the Allocation attribute.
    For classes where all instances are created at runtime,
    this attribute is set to the maximum number of the instances that can exist
    at the same time.
    For classes where all the instances are created at population time
    and no instances are created at run time,
    this attribute can be set to zero.
    For classes where some instances are specified at population time and
    others are created at run time,
    this attribute sets the initial space available for dynamic instance
    creation.

=== Static Class Population

A Static Class Population is that type of class population where the

Class \{I,R102}::
    The name of the class to which the class population applies.
[horizontal]
    Data Type::: Refers to Element Population.Element
IsConstant::
    This attribute determines whether the space for storage of the class
    instances is to be allocated to read only memory.
    A static class population may have the additional characteristics that they
    do not have any attributes that are updated at run time and do not have a
    state model.
    This is often the case of classes that hold specification information.
    For some platforms, holding that data in read only memory may be
    of benefit.
    Setting this attribute to true for classes that have any run time
    behavior may result in undefined behavior.
