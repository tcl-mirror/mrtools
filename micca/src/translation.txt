= Translation

== Introduction

In this section,
we give an overview of model translation and how `micca` fits into
the larger scheme of modeling and translation.
First,
we consider an idealized view of software development by modeling and
translation.
Next, we compare how a `micca` translation workflow compares to
the idealized one.

=== Translation Reference Model
<<auto-translation>> shows an idealized workflow for translating
and executable model.

=== Micca Translation Model

<<micca-translation>> shows the workflow when `micca` is used to accomplish
the translation of an executable model.
