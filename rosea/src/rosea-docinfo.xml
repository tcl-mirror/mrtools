    <authorinitials>GAM</authorinitials>
    <revremark>
        Corrected problem with associative classes that also have

    <date>November 10, 2015</date>
    <authorinitials>GAM</authorinitials>
    <revremark>
        Added system supplied and generated default values.
        System supplied defaults are implemented as sequential integers
        and generated defaults are the result of running a command.

    <date>November 18, 2015</date>
    <authorinitials>GAM</authorinitials>
    <revremark>
        Added restore command to populate domain from a previously
        saved data set.
        Added info command for domain introspection.

  <revision>
    <revnumber>1.6.1</revnumber>
    <date>November 23, 2015</date>
    <authorinitials>GAM</authorinitials>
    <revremark>
        Corrected a problem with saving the domain class population.
        Because of naming conventions, the current state values for
        class with state models were not being saved.
    </revremark>

  <revision>
    <revnumber>1.6.2</revnumber>
    <date>December 29, 2015</date>
    <authorinitials>GAM</authorinitials>
    <revremark>
        Corrected a problem finding unrelated instances across an
        associative relationship.
        Corrected a problem when polymorphic events were consumed by
        in intermediate level state model.
        Domain must now be configured in one invocation of the domain
        command. Cumulative domain definition can't be made to work.

    <date>February 1, 2016</date>
    <authorinitials>GAM</authorinitials>
    <revremark>
    Corrected a problem with subtype migration.
    The migrate procedure contained an extraneous "relvar eval" around the
    delete / create sequence.

    <date>February 14, 2016</date>
    <authorinitials>GAM</authorinitials>

    relationships is navigated to a subclass that does not exist in
    the generalization.

    <revnumber>1.6.5</revnumber>
    <date>March 22, 2016</date>
    <authorinitials>GAM</authorinitials>
    <revremark>
    Corrected problem with updateAttribute and withAttribute commands.
    These commands were double evaluating the content of the update
    which caused problems when the attribute contained Tcl meta-characters.

    <revnumber>1.7</revnumber>
    <date>August 23, 2017</date>
    <authorinitials>GAM</authorinitials>

    <revnumber>1.8</revnumber>
    <date>October 25, 2017</date>
    <authorinitials>GAM</authorinitials>
    <revremark>
        Added "idClass" command for multiple assigners to be able
        to access the class instance used for partitioning the
        multiple assigner instances.
    </revremark>

    <revnumber>1.9</revnumber>
    <date>May 5, 2020</date>
    <authorinitials>GAM</authorinitials>
    <revremark>
        Corrected a problem with polymorphic event dispatch across
        repeated generalizations.
        Dispatch only happened on the first level of a multi-level hierarchy.
        Corrected problems in formatting the polymorphic event traces.
    </revremark>
  </revision>
  <revision>
    <revnumber>1.9.1</revnumber>
    <date>May 6, 2020</date>
    <authorinitials>GAM</authorinitials>
    <revremark>
        Corrected a problem with generation of seqdiag output for polymorphic
        events.
        Minor changes in the formatting of event traces.
        Changed the tracing of a cascade of repeated polymorphic events
        so that the target of the previous event polymorphic event
        becomes the source for the next one.
        Previously, all polymorphic events appear to have originated from
        the source instance of the first one.
    </revremark>
  </revision>
  <revision>
    <revnumber>1.9.2</revnumber>
    <date>May 7, 2020</date>
    <authorinitials>GAM</authorinitials>
    <revremark>
        Corrected a regression introduced in version 1.9.1.
        The changes to the mapping of polymorphic events so that it appears
        that the events cascade down a hierarchy disguises the origin
        of the event.
        If the original source of the event was outside of a state machine
        context, it would appear that the event originated from within a
        state machine and fail to start the required data transaction.
