ROSEA -- A Relation Oriented Software Execution Architecture

                            Abstract

Rosea is a Tcl package that implements a data and execution domain that is
suitable as the target platform for translating executable software models into
programs using Tcl as the implementation language.  Translation is accomplished
by capturing the characteristics of the software model using a domain specific
language from which the data structures used by the run time component are
built.  This paper presents the design and implementation of rosea showing how
Executable UML model semantics are mapped to Tcl language constructs.  Model
classes are held in relation variables and class relationships are enforced as
referential integrity constraints between the relation variables.  Dynamics are
implemented as Moore type finite state machines.  Processing is event driven
and transactional in nature with the state of the program data being rolled
back if integrity checks fail.
