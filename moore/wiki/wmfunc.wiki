<h3>Washing Machine Functionality</h3>
<p>
Even a cursory examination of the previous state machine graphic will show
that our washing machine is very basic.
There are only three parameters to the machine
and those are used to control the timing of the cycles.
Hardware failures and error conditions are not accomodated at all.
These are the unfortunate consequences of examples.
Here we will stick to minimal functionality in the hope that the washing
machine operation does not confuse our real interest, namely how to
make the state machine in the <b>moore</b> package.

<p>
In this state model,
the initial state is <em>Idle</em>.
The cycle is started by the <em>Run</em> event.
A combination of events from the sensor in the tub and delayed events
then drives the washing machine through its cycle.
