<h3>
A Simple Example</h3>Let's start with a simple example. You may wish to first look at the manual documentation for&nbsp; the <a href="/doc/ckout/moore/doc/moore.html" target="_blank">moore package</a> or you can just follow along.<br><h4>Washing machine</h4>The subject of this example will be a simple washing machine. Washing machines exhibit a circular pattern in that they proceed to perform their operations one step after another, eventually returning to the original state.<br><br>Our washing machine consists of several components that we need to control:<br><ul><li>A water valve that we can open and close.</li><li>A washing tub where the clothes and water are washed. The tub has a sensor that can tell us when the tub is full of water and when it is empty.</li><li>A pump to remove water from the tub.</li><li>A motor that can be used to agitate the clothes and spin the water out of them.<br></li></ul><br><a href="/doc/ckout/moore/wiki/terms.wiki">Previous</a> <a href="/doc/ckout/moore/wiki/wmach.wiki">Next</a><br><br>
