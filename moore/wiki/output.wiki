<h3>Running the Example</h3>
<p>
Running the example code
[/doc/trunk/moore/wiki/wash_run.html|produces]
the output of the state actions interleaved
with the state machine traces to show exactly what happened.
<p>
The first trace shows that the <b>Run</b> event was dispatched from
outside of a state machine to the <b>::wm1</b> state machine and the
event carried no parameters.
The second trace line shows the result of delivering the event.
The <b>::wm1</b> state machine transitioned from the <b>Idle</b>
state to the <b>FillingForWashing</b> state.
So on line 3 we see the result of executing the action associated with
the <b>FillingForWashing</b> state.
The remaining lines of output show the completion of the washing cycle.
