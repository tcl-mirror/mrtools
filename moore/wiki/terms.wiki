<h3>
Terminology</h3>At this point it is necessary to be a bit more precise about the terminology. Before we have used the terms <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">state machine</span> and <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">state model</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span> somewhat interchangeably. Now we want to be more precise. We talk about a <span style="font-style: italic;">state model</span> as the specification of states, events&nbsp; and transitions and the we talk about a <span style="font-style: italic;">state machine</span>
as being a running instance of a state model. In essence the state
model is the definition and the state machine is the instance each of
which have their own notion of current state.<br>
<br>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">moore</span> package makes the
same distinction. There is a command to define the state model and then
an arbitrary number of state machines may be instanciated from the
state model. It is analogous to defining an object oriented class and
then instanciating objects from the class.<br><br><a href="/doc/ckout/moore/wiki/smtype.wiki">Previous</a> <a href="/doc/ckout/moore/wiki/example1.wiki">Next</a><br><br>
