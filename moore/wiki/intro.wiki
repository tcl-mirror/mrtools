<h3>
Moore Type State Machines in Tcl</h3>Finite state machines are a powerful abstraction that can be used to structure the sequencing of programs. There are many examples of state machines out there and even a casual search of the <a href="http://wiki.tcl.tk" target="_blank">Tcl Wiki</a> shows many examples of how to implement simple state machines.<br><br>For more complicated programs, the simple examples of the wiki are not sufficient. There are several requirements that are needed to use state machines in larger program.<br><ul><li>We need to be able to specify a state model that can be instanciated multiple times. There may be several instances of the same entity in a program and each instance must have the same behavior.</li><li>We need to be able to both generated events to the state machine as well as generate a delayed event. A delayed event is one that is delivered at some time in the future. Events need to operate well with the Tcl event loop.<br></li></ul>
