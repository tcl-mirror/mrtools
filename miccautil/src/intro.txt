== Introduction

This document describes the `miccautil` package.
`Miccautil` is a pure Tcl package that is intended to accompany
the `micca` XUML translation tool.

=== Background

https://repos.modelrealization.com/cgi-bin/fossil/mrtools/wiki?name=MiccaPage[Micca]
is a program to aid in the translation of
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_UML[Executable UML]
domain models into ``C'' code.
During the translation process,
information about the platform specific model is input to `micca` via
a domain specific language.
Executing the domain specific language populates a relational model
of the domain which is then used to generate the translation code.
Upon request,
`micca` will serialize the populated relation model of a domain.
The `miccautil` package is used to access the platform specific model
population and query common aspects of it.
Note that `miccautil` is not _required_ to access the domain model.
It simply provides a set of more common, and sometimes more complex,
queries on the model population.
It is quite feasable to deserialize the domain model population
(either using the TclRAL native format or SQLite format) and write
custom queries against it.
The platform specific schema is given in the
https://repos.modelrealization.com/cgi-bin/fossil/mrtools/doc/trunk/micca/doc/micca.pdf[micca literate program document].

=== Overview

The `miccautil` package is based on TclOO.
The package exports a single class name, `model`.
Instances of `model` are bound to a single domain.
Methods in the `model` instance support the queries for the package.
