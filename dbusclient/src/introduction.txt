== Introduction

This document is about a Tcl package named `dbusclient`.
`Dbusclient` is a Tcl package that facilitates interacting with
a DBus daemon to obtain services from other programs on a DBus.

DBus is an inter-process communications mechanism that supports
remote procedure call and asynchronous notifications.
It is typically used in Linux systems to provide a means for
various system services to be organized.
The
https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html[DBus specification]
gives the details of the protocol.

This document is also a
