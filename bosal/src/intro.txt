== Harnessing Micca Generated Domains

=== Introduction

The `micca` run-time is capable of executing in a POSIX environment.
This is intended primarily to be able to simulate and integrate
a system that is ultimately targeted for a micro-processor in an
environment that has more capability for testing and introspection.
To support this important activity,
`micca` can automatically generate a test harness in which one or
more domains may be run.
