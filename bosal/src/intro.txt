== Harnessing Micca Generated Domains

This document is about a program named `bosal`.
This document is also a literate program and contains all the design
information and code for the `bosal` program.
Readers unfamiliar with literate programs should consult the
<<literate-programming,appendix>> for more details.


=== Introduction

When `micca` is used to translate an xUML domain into code,
the resuling ``C'' file can be combined with a `main` function
and any necessary external entity stubsfootnote:[`micca` can also
generate the external entity stubs] to build an executable of the
domain.
The resulting executable, unfortunately, does not do very much.
A domain in isolation, without being bridged to other service domains,
doesn't have any way of being triggered to execute.



The `micca` run-time is capable of executing in a POSIX environment.
This is intended primarily to be able to simulate and integrate
a system that is ultimately targeted for a micro-processor in an
environment that has more capability for testing and introspection.
To support this important activity,
`micca` can automatically generate a test harness in which one or
more domains may be run.
