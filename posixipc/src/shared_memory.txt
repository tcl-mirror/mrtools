== Shared Memory

POSIX shared memory mechanisms are implemented in Linux using a virtual
file system.
Opening a shared memory object creates a file at a specfic location in
the file system.
The object exists until either the system is rebooted or the shared
memory is explicitly unlinked.
To use shared memory,
it is mapped into the address space of the process.
At that point,
it just looks like any other data memory.

The Tcl channel metaphor extends well to shared memory.
However,
since the memory is shared between multiple processes,
some form of exclusive access must be implemented to insure the
sharing processes do not interfer with each other.
We use a POSIX semaphore for that purpose.
The *wait* and *post* operations on the semaphore are kept as part
of the channel operations and are not exposed to the script level.
The semaphore is only locked for a long as necessary to copy memory
to and from the shared area.

In what follows, we present the Tcl channel driver functions first,
followed by the script level Tcl commands.

=== Shared Memory Channel Driver

In this section we present the channel driver for the POSIX shared
memory type channel.

==== Channel Driver Components

In this section,
we describe the functions supplied for the Tcl channel driver that
is used for POSIX shared memory.
This is similar to what was supplied for the message queue driver.

The following is an initialized variable of the proper structure
that is given to `Tcl_CreateChannel()` to define the shared memory operations.

} ;
----

Notice that not all functions are provided (_i.e._ some members of the
structure are set to `NULL`).
Those members are:

setOptionProc::
    There are no channel type specific options that can be written.
getOptionProc::
    There are no channel type specific options that can be read.
close2Proc::
    For shared memory,
    the idea of closing read or write separately does not apply.
flushProc::
    This is reserved.
handlerProc::
    Used only for stacked drivers.
wideSeekProc::
    We assume shared memory areas are less than 2 GiBytes so wide seeking
    is not necessary.
threadActionProc::
    There is no thread specific driver state.
truncateProc::
    Once created, the size of a shared memory object underlying
    the channel is not changed.

When a new shared memory Tcl channel is created,
some instance data for the channel may also be supplied.
That instance data is then provided as an argument to each of the
functions for the driver.
This makes things much more convenient for the driver function code
to have access to the state of the channel.
The following data structure defines the information that constitutes
the state of an individual shared memory channel.

(((chunk,shm data types)))
[source,c]
----
<<shm data types>>=
typedef struct {
    Tcl_Channel channel ;       // <1>
    int shmfd ;                 // <2>
    sem_t *semaphore ;          // <3>
    int tclMask ;               // <4>
    int blockingMode ;          // <5>
    uint8_t *address ;          // <6>
    size_t length ;             // <7>
    size_t position ;           // <8>
} ShmState ;
----
<1> The Tcl channel handle as returned from `Tcl_CreateChannel()`.
<2> The shared memory descriptor. In reality on Linux this is
    an ordinary file descriptor.
<3> The semaphore used to control exclusive access to the shared memory.
<4> A mask of allowed operations on the channel.
    This is combination of TCL_READABLE or TCL_WRITABLE.
<5> The current state of blocking mode for the channel.
<6> The address in memory where the shared memory area is located.
<7> The length in bytes of the shared memory area.
<8> The current position in the shared memory area where the next
    read or write will occur.

The following sections describe each of the functions supplied as part
of the shared memory channel driver.

===== Close procedure

(((chunk,shm forward function declarations)))
[source,c]
----
<<shm forward function declarations>>=
static int shmCloseProc(ClientData instanceData, Tcl_Interp *interp) ;
----

To close a share memory object,
we must unmap it,
close the underlying file, and
close the exclusion semaphore.
Should an error occur in this process,
we want to continue to finish all the operations.
We report the last error that occurred.

(((chunk,shm static function definitions)))
[source,c]
----
<<shm static function definitions>>=
static int
shmCloseProc(
    ClientData instanceData,
    Tcl_Interp *interp)
{
    ShmState *shmData = instanceData ;

    Tcl_DeleteFileHandler(shmData->shmfd) ;

    int resultCode = 0 ;

    int syserr = munmap(shmData->address, shmData->length) ;
    if (syserr < 0) {
        resultCode = errno ;
    }

    syserr = close(shmData->shmfd) ;
    if (syserr < 0) {
        resultCode = errno ;
    }

    syserr = sem_close(shmData->semaphore) ;
    if (syserr < 0) {
        resultCode = errno ;
    }

    ckfree(shmData) ;
    return resultCode ;
}
----

===== Input procedure

(((chunk,shm forward function declarations)))
[source,c]
----
<<shm forward function declarations>>=
static int shmInputProc(ClientData instanceData, char *buf, int bufSize,
        int *errorCodePtr) ;
----

Input from the share memory is just copying from memory.
There is necessary book keeping to make sure we don't run off the
end of the memory area.
Also,
we must acquire the semaphore used to insure exclusive access to the
shared memory.

(((chunk,shm static function definitions)))
[source,c]
----
<<shm static function definitions>>=
static int
shmInputProc(
    ClientData instanceData,
    char *buf,
    int bufSize,
    int *errorCodePtr)
{
    ShmState *shmData = instanceData ;

    <<shm: lock semaphore>>

    size_t remaining = shmData->length - shmData->position ;
    int toRead = bufSize < remaining ? bufSize : remaining ;

    memcpy(buf, shmData->address + shmData->position, toRead) ;
    shmData->position += toRead ;

    <<shm: unlock semaphore>>

    return toRead ;
}
----

We interpret non-blocking mode as not wanting to wait on the
semaphore for access to the shared memory.
We don't anticipate this to be a common situation.
The semaphore is _hidden_ in the channel driver and is only
locked during the memory copy operations.
So there seems little reason to use non-blocking mode
for the shared memory.

.lock semaphore
(((chunk,shm: lock semaphore)))
[source,c]
----
<<shm: lock semaphore>>=
int syserr ;
if (shmData->blockingMode == TCL_MODE_NONBLOCKING) {
    syserr = sem_trywait(shmData->semaphore) ;
    if (syserr == -1) {
        *errorCodePtr = errno ;
        return -1 ;
    }
} else {
    syserr = sem_wait(shmData->semaphore) ;
    if (syserr == -1) {
        *errorCodePtr = errno ;
        return -1 ;
    }
}
----

.unlock semaphore
(((chunk,shm: unlock semaphore)))
[source,c]
----
<<shm: unlock semaphore>>=
syserr = sem_post(shmData->semaphore) ;
if (syserr == -1) {
    *errorCodePtr = errno ;
    return -1 ;
}
----

===== Output procedure

(((chunk,shm forward function declarations)))
[source,c]
----
<<shm forward function declarations>>=
static int shmOutputProc(ClientData instanceData, char const *buf, int toWrite,
        int *errorCodePtr) ;
----

Like input,
output to the share memory is nothing more than copying data to the
shared memory area.
Again, there is some book keeping to account for boundaries
and we must acquire the semaphore to have exclusive access to the
underlying data.

(((chunk,shm static function definitions)))
[source,c]
----
<<shm static function definitions>>=
static int
shmOutputProc(
    ClientData instanceData,
    char const *buf,
    int toWrite,
    int *errorCodePtr)
{
    ShmState *shmData = instanceData ;

    <<shm: lock semaphore>>

    size_t available = shmData->length - shmData->position ;
    int canWrite = toWrite < available ? toWrite : available ;

    memcpy(shmData->address + shmData->position, buf, canWrite) ;
    shmData->position += canWrite ;

    <<shm: unlock semaphore>>

    return canWrite ;
}
----

===== Seek procedure

(((chunk,shm forward function declarations)))
[source,c]
----
<<shm forward function declarations>>=
static int shmSeekProc(ClientData instanceData, long offset, int seekMode,
        int *errorCodePtr) ;
----

The seeking operation in shared memory is just moving the notion of
the current position to a new place in memory.
Of course, we must account for boundary conditions and the way relative
offsets are specified for the seek operation.

(((chunk,shm static function definitions)))
[source,c]
----
<<shm static function definitions>>=
static int
shmSeekProc(
    ClientData instanceData,
    long offset,
    int seekMode,
    int *errorCodePtr)
{
    ShmState *shmData = instanceData ;

    off_t start = 0 ;                   // <1>
    switch (seekMode) {
    case SEEK_SET:
        start = 0 ;
        break ;

    case SEEK_CUR:
        start = shmData->position ;
        break ;

    case SEEK_END:
        start = shmData->length - 1 ;
        break ;

    default:
        Tcl_Panic("unknown seek mode") ;
        break ;
    }

    off_t newPosition = start + offset ;
    if (newPosition < 0 || newPosition >= shmData->length) {
        *errorCodePtr = EINVAL ;
        return -1 ;
    }

    shmData->position = newPosition ;
    return newPosition ;
}
----
<1> This prevents some compiler warnings.

===== Watch procedure

(((chunk,shm forward function declarations)))
[source,c]
----
<<shm forward function declarations>>=
static void shmWatchProc(ClientData instanceData, int mask) ;
----

We set the watch on the file descriptor for the shared memory,
but it is not clear that this is a useful thing.

(((chunk,shm static function definitions)))
[source,c]
----
<<shm static function definitions>>=
static void
shmWatchProc(
    ClientData instanceData,
    int mask)
{
    ShmState *shmData = instanceData ;

    mask &= shmData->tclMask ;
    if (mask != 0) {
        Tcl_CreateFileHandler(shmData->shmfd, mask,
                (Tcl_FileProc *)Tcl_NotifyChannel, shmData->channel) ;
    } else {
        Tcl_DeleteFileHandler(shmData->shmfd) ;
    }
}
----

===== Get handle procedure

(((chunk,shm forward function declarations)))
[source,c]
----
<<shm forward function declarations>>=
static int shmGetHandleProc(ClientData instanceData, int direction,
        ClientData *handlePtr) ;
----

Again, the underlying shared memory identifier is, in reality,
an ordinary file descriptor.

(((chunk,shm static function definitions)))
[source,c]
----
<<shm static function definitions>>=
static int
shmGetHandleProc(
    ClientData instanceData,
    int direction,
    ClientData *handlePtr)
{
    ShmState *shmData = instanceData ;

    if ((direction & shmData->tclMask) == 0) {
        return TCL_ERROR ;
    }

    *handlePtr = (ClientData)(intptr_t)(shmData->shmfd) ;
    return TCL_OK ;
}
----

===== Block mode procedure

(((chunk,shm forward function declarations)))
[source,c]
----
<<shm forward function declarations>>=
static int shmBlockModeProc(ClientData instanceData, int mode) ;
----

We need only to record the blocking mode so that it may be used
to decide how to wait for the exclusion semaphore.

(((chunk,shm static function definitions)))
[source,c]
----
<<shm static function definitions>>=
static int
shmBlockModeProc(
    ClientData instanceData,
    int mode)
{
    ShmState *shmData = instanceData ;

    shmData->blockingMode = mode ;

    return 0 ;
}
----

=== Opening a Shared Memory Channel

Just as for message queues,
we provide an external function that may be called by a ``C'' based
extension to open an message queue channel.
We don't expect that to be a common use case,
but it is convenient when necessary and we will use the same function
to provide the Tcl script level command to open a message queue channel.

(((chunk,shm external functions definitions)))
[source,c]
----
<<shm external functions definitions>>=
Tcl_Channel
PosixIPC_OpenSHMChannel(
    Tcl_Interp *interp,
    Tcl_Obj *name,
    char const *mode,
    mode_t permissions,
    off_t size)
{
    int flags = 0 ;
    int tclMask = 0 ;
    bool bintrans = false ;

    <<OpenSHMChannel: process arguments>>

    int syserr ;
    char const *shmname = Tcl_GetString(name) ;

    <<OpenSHMChannel: open semaphore>>
    <<OpenSHMChannel: open shared memory>>
    <<OpenSHMChannel: size shared memory>>
    <<OpenSHMChannel: map shared memory>>

    Tcl_Channel shmChan ;
    <<OpenSHMChannel: create shared memory channel>>
    <<OpenSHMChannel: set translation option>>

    return shmChan ;

release_chan:
    Tcl_Close(interp, shmChan) ;
    ckfree(shmdata) ;

release_shm:
    close(shmfd) ;
    shm_unlink(shmname) ;

release_sem:
    sem_close(shmsem) ;
    sem_unlink(shmname) ;

    return NULL ;
}
----

Like message queues,
shared memory also uses the same argument conventions for mode and
access.

.processing arguments
(((chunk,OpenSHMChannel: process arguments)))
[source,c]
----
<<OpenSHMChannel: process arguments>>=
if (islower(*mode)) {
    if (processFopenModeOption(interp, mode, &flags, &tclMask, &bintrans) !=
            TCL_OK) {
        return NULL ;
    }
} else {
    if (processOpenModeOption(interp, mode, &flags, &tclMask, &bintrans) !=
            TCL_OK) {
        return NULL ;
    }
}

if ((flags & O_CREAT) != 0 && size <= 0) {              // <1>
    if (interp != NULL) {
        Tcl_SetObjResult(interp,
                Tcl_ObjPrintf("shared memory size must be positive")) ;
    }
    return NULL ;
}
----
<1> A non-positive size is not meaningful.

.opening the semaphore
(((chunk,OpenSHMChannel: open semaphore)))
[source,c]
----
<<OpenSHMChannel: open semaphore>>=
sem_t *shmsem = sem_open(shmname, flags, permissions, 1) ;      // <1>
if (shmsem == SEM_FAILED) {
    shmFailure(interp, "cannot open shared memory exclusive access semaphore") ;
    return NULL ;
}
----
<1> Use the same flags for opening the semaphore as for opening
the shared memory object.

Since it is possible to have system calls related to shared memory fail,
we specialize `ipcFailure()` for shared memory use.

(((chunk,shm forward function declarations)))
[source,c]
----
<<shm forward function declarations>>=
static int shmFailure(Tcl_Interp *interp, char const *msg) ;
----

(((chunk,shm static function definitions)))
[source,c]
----
<<shm static function definitions>>=
static int
shmFailure(
    Tcl_Interp *interp,
    char const *msg)
{
    return ipcFailure(interp, "shm", msg) ;
}
----

We need a check on the arguments to make sure don't end up with
shared memory of zero length.

(((chunk,OpenSHMChannel: open shared memory)))
[source,c]
----
<<OpenSHMChannel: open shared memory>>=
int shmfd = shm_open(shmname, flags, permissions) ;
if (shmfd < 0) {
    shmFailure(interp, shmname) ;
    goto release_sem ;
}
----

When a shared memory object is created,
it has a zero size and we need to `ftruncate()` the underlying
file to give it the requested size.
The complication here is knowing whether we have actually created
the shared memory object or whether it was already there when
we tried to open it.
The answer is to look at the size of the shared memory object.
A zero size indicates we actually created the share memory object and
need to expand it to the requested size.
Since, the shared memory object is represented by a file descriptor,
`fstat()` will give the required information.

(((chunk,OpenSHMChannel: size shared memory)))
[source,c]
----
<<OpenSHMChannel: size shared memory>>=
struct stat shmStatus ;
syserr = fstat(shmfd, &shmStatus) ;
if (syserr < 0) {
    shmFailure(interp, "cannot get status of shared memory") ;
    goto release_shm ;
}

if (shmStatus.st_size == 0) {
    int syserr = ftruncate(shmfd, size) ;
    if (syserr < 0) {
        shmFailure(interp,
                "cannot set the size of shared memory using ftruncate()") ;
        goto release_shm ;
    }
} else {
    size = shmStatus.st_size ;
}
----

The last bit of systems programming is to map the shared memory object
into the process address space.
Since the shared memory is really a file,
then `mmap()` is used to perform the mapping.
It's just a matter of computing the flag values based on the
direction of data flow.

(((chunk,OpenSHMChannel: map shared memory)))
[source,c]
----
<<OpenSHMChannel: map shared memory>>=
int mapProt = 0 ;
mapProt |= (tclMask & TCL_READABLE) != 0 ? PROT_READ : 0 ;
mapProt |= (tclMask & TCL_WRITABLE) != 0 ? PROT_WRITE : 0 ;

void *mapaddr = mmap(NULL, size, mapProt, MAP_SHARED, shmfd, 0) ;
if (mapaddr == MAP_FAILED) {
    shmFailure(interp, shmname) ;
    goto release_shm ;
}
----

Once all the required system programming is done,
we can now turn the shared memory and its associated semaphore
into a Tcl channel.
We allocate the data object used to deal with the state of the channel
and call Tcl to create it.

(((chunk,OpenSHMChannel: create shared memory channel)))
[source,c]
----
<<OpenSHMChannel: create shared memory channel>>=
char chanName[TCL_INTEGER_SPACE + 16] ;
snprintf(chanName, sizeof(chanName), "posixshm%d", shmfd) ;

ShmState *shmdata = ckalloc(sizeof(ShmState)) ;
shmdata->shmfd = shmfd ;
shmdata->semaphore = shmsem ;
shmdata->tclMask = tclMask ;
shmdata->blockingMode = (flags & O_NONBLOCK) != 0 ?
        TCL_MODE_NONBLOCKING : TCL_MODE_BLOCKING ;
shmdata->address = mapaddr ;
shmdata->length = size ;
shmdata->position = 0 ;
shmdata->channel = shmChan =
        Tcl_CreateChannel(&ShmChannelType, chanName, shmdata, tclMask) ;
----

If the channel was opened in binary mode,
we need to instruct the Tcl channel system to set the translation properly.

(((chunk,OpenSHMChannel: set translation option)))
[source,c]
----
<<OpenSHMChannel: set translation option>>=
if (bintrans) {
    if (Tcl_SetChannelOption(interp, shmChan, "-translation", "binary") !=
            TCL_OK) {
        goto release_chan ;
    }
}
----

=== Shared Memory Commands

In this section,
we present the ``C'' code that implements the Tcl script level commands
for shared memory.
Per the usual conventions,
we provide a command to open a shared memory channel.
The usual Tcl channel commands can then be used to read or write to the
channel.
Like, message queues,
shared memory is special in that it can be unlinked and a separate command
is provided for that (_i.e._ unlinking is different than closing).

==== shm open command

*******
`posixipc shm open` ?options? shmname +
`posixipc shm open` ?options? shmname ?access? +
`posixipc shm open` ?options? shmname ?access? ?permissions?

options::
    -size _bytes_;;
        The size of the shared memory in bytes. This option must be supplied
        if the shared memory object is to be created.
        This option is not required if an existing shared memory object
        is being opened nor can the size of an existing shared memory
        object be changed as part of opening it.
shmname::
    The name of shared memory object. Shared memory names must start with
    a slash (/) character and may *not* contain any other slash
    characters.
access::
    The _access_ argument, if present, indicates the way in which the
    shared memory is to be accessed.
    In the first form, _access_ may have any of the following forms:
    r;;
        Open the shared memory for reading only.
        The shared memory must already exist.
        This is the default if _access_ is not specified.
    r+;;
        Open the shared memory for reading and writing.
        The shared memory must already exist.
    w;;
        Open the shared memory for writing only.
        Create the shared memory if it does not already exist.
    w+;;
        Open the shared memory for reading and writing.
        Create the shared memory if it does not already exist.

+
All legal _access_ values above may have the character *b* added
as the second or third character in the value to indicate that the
opened channel should be configured as if with the
*fconfigure -translation binary* option, making the channel suitable
for reading or writing of binary data.
+
In the second form,
_access_ consists of a list of any of the following flags,
all of which have the standard POSIX meanings.
Exactly one flags must be either *RDONLY*, *WRONLY*, or *RDWR*.

    RDONLY;;
        Open the shared memory for reading only.
    WRONLY;;
        Open the shared memory for writing only.
    RDWR;;
        Open the shared memory for both reading and writing.
    BINARY;;
        Configure the opened channel with the *-translation binary* option.
    CREAT;;
        Create the shared memory if it does not already exist.
    EXCL;;
        If *CREAT* is also specified, an error is returned if the
        shared memory already exists.
    NONBLOCK;;
        Prevent the process from blocking in subsequent I/O operations.

permissions::
    If the shared memory is created as part of opening it,
    _permissions_ is used to set the permissions for the new message
    queue in conjunction withthe process's file mode creation mask.
    _Permissions_ defaults to 0666.

==== shm unlink command

Like message queue,
shared memory has a presence in the file system.
Unlinking removes the name of the shared memory object and the
shared memory is deleted when there are no open references to it.
This operation can be done through the file system, but that requires
knowledge that the share memory resides in a virtual file system and
knowledge of where that file system is mounted.
Further,
using this call also cleans up any associated exclusion semaphore.

*******
`posixipc shm unlink shmname`

shmname::
    The name of shared memory object. Shared memory object names must start
    with a slash (/) character and may *not* contain any other slash
    characters.

The `unlink` command removes the shared memory object named, `shmname`,
from the system.
The shared memory is actually destroyed when all processes that have open
descriptors for the shared memory close those descriptors.
